# Z80Emu

## YAZ80Emu - Yet another Z80 emulator!
Yes, another Z80 emulator.\
It's more like a passion project, but we write a Z80 emulator, just for pure fun


## Limitations
Currently there are some limitations:
- The "RST 0x.." instruction is not fully tested
- The "EX .." and "EXX" instructions are not validated but are considered working (hopefully)
- In the Main instruction set are still a lot of instructions unimplemented at the lower part

- The extended instructions can not be accessed currently
- The IX instructions can not be accessed currently, and following to them the IXCB
- The IY instructions can not be accessed currently, and following to them the IYCB

### We work on testing, researching or validating every instruction (some just take their time)
If someone is interested in supporting us, validating instructions would be a good idea!
